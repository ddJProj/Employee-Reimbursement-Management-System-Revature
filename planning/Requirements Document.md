# Employee Reimbursement System - Requirements Document

## 1. Functional Requirements

### 1.1 User Authentication
- Allow new user registration with email and password
- Validate password strength (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)
- Authenticate users with email/password login
- Generate and return JWT token on successful auth
- Store JWT in localStorage for session persistence
- Restore user session on page refresh
- Allow users to logout and invalidate their token
- Redirect unauthenticated users to login page
- Prevent duplicate email registration

### 1.2 User Management
- Assign RESTRICTED role to newly registered users
- Allow restricted users to request upgrade to EMPLOYEE role
- Auto-approve upgrade requests (no manual approval needed in this iteration)
- Update user role in system and auth context
- Allow managers to view all users in system
- Allow managers to delete users (except themselves)
- Prevent deletion of own account

### 1.3 Reimbursement Management (Employee)
- Allow employees to create reimbursement requests
- Require description (min 10 chars) and type selection
- Support types: FOOD, AIRLINE, GAS, HOTEL, SUPPLIES, OTHER
- Set status to PENDING when created
- Allow employees to view all their own reimbursements
- Allow filtering by status (ALL, PENDING, APPROVED, DENIED)
- Display reimbursement details (ID, description, type, status)
- List reimbursements newest first
- Show employee's email on each reimbursement

### 1.4 Reimbursement Management (Manager)
- Allow managers to view ALL reimbursements from all employees
- Allow filtering by status (ALL, PENDING, APPROVED, DENIED)
- Display employee email for each reimbursement
- Allow approval/denial of pending reimbursements
- Require confirmation before approving/denying
- Allow optional comment when resolving
- Update status to APPROVED or DENIED
- Prevent resolving already-processed reimbursements
- Refresh list after resolution
- Only allow managers to resolve reimbursements

### 1.5 Role-Based Access Control
- Route users to correct dashboard based on role
- Show role-appropriate navigation options
- Hide features user doesn't have access to
- Check permissions before allowing operations
- Enforce role restrictions on backend
- Return 401/403 for unauthorized requests

### 1.6 Navigation & Routing
- Provide sidebar nav with role-based menu items
- Show user email and role in sidebar
- Include logout button in sidebar
- Redirect to role-specific dashboard after login
- Handle direct URL navigation properly
- Show loading state during auth checks
- Redirect "/" to login page

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Security
- Hash passwords with BCrypt before storage
- Never return passwords in API responses
- Validate JWT tokens on every protected request
- Use token blacklist to invalidate on logout
- Enable CORS only for trusted origins (localhost:5173)
- Validate all user inputs on backend
- Sanitize data before database operations

### 2.2 Usability
- Show clear error messages for validation failures
- Display loading indicators during async operations
- Provide visual feedback on form submissions
- Use consistent terminology throughout UI
- Make clickable elements obvious
- Show confirmation for destructive actions
- Auto-clear form after successful submission

### 2.3 Maintainability
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow consistent code organization
- Separate concerns (UI, logic, API)
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Keep components focused and small



## 3. Data Requirements

### 3.1 User Data
- Store user ID (auto-generated)
- Store email (unique, required)
- Store password hash (never plain text)
- Store role (GUEST, RESTRICTED, EMPLOYEE, MANAGER)
- Derive permissions from role enum (not stored)

### 3.2 Reimbursement Data
- Store reimbursement ID (auto-generated)
- Store user ID (creator)
- Store description (text, min 10 chars)
- Store type (enum value)
- Store status (PENDING, APPROVED, DENIED)
- Order by ID descending (newest first)

### 3.3 Data Validation
- Email must match standard email format
- Password must meet complexity requirements
- Description must be at least 10 characters
- Type must be valid enum value
- Status changes must follow valid transitions
- Only pending reimbursements can be edited

## 4. Integration Requirements

### 4.1 Frontend-Backend Communication
- Use REST API with JSON payloads
- Include JWT token in Authorization header
- Handle HTTP status codes properly
- Parse error responses consistently
- Use Axios for all API calls
- Configure base URL via environment

### 4.2 API Endpoints
- Prefix all endpoints with `/api`
- Use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Provide meaningful error messages

## 5. Business Rules

### 5.1 User Roles
- New users start as RESTRICTED
- RESTRICTED can only request upgrade
- EMPLOYEE can manage own reimbursements
- MANAGER can manage all users and reimbursements
- Role hierarchy: GUEST < RESTRICTED < EMPLOYEE < MANAGER

### 5.2 Reimbursement Workflow
- Employee creates request (status: PENDING)
- Manager reviews and approves/denies
- Status changes to APPROVED or DENIED
- Can't edit after resolution
- Can't change resolved status
- Only managers can resolve

### 5.3 Permission Model
- Permissions tied to roles
- Can't have permission without role
- Managers have all permissions
- Permission checks on every operation
- Backend enforces all permissions

### 5.4 Account Management
- Can't delete own account
- Can't downgrade own role
- Can't create users with MANAGER role
- Only one upgrade path (RESTRICTED â†’ EMPLOYEE)
- Email must be unique across system

## 6. User Interface Requirements

### 6.1 Layout
- Fixed sidebar on left
- Main content area on right
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Responsive to window size

### 6.2 Forms
- Clear field labels
- Placeholder text in inputs
- Required fields marked
- Submit and cancel buttons
- Validation feedback inline
- Disable inputs during submission

### 6.3 Lists
- Show item count
- Display status badges
- Sort newest first
- Filter options at top
- Empty state messaging
- Item actions clearly visible

### 6.4 Feedback
- Success messages after actions
- Error messages on failures
- Loading states during async ops
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Status indicators (pending/approved/denied)

## 7. Error Handling Requirements (More work still needed)

### 7.1 Frontend Errors
- Catch all API call failures
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Never show technical stack traces
- Log errors to console for debugging
- Recover gracefully from errors
- Clear errors when user retries

### 7.2 Backend Errors
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Include error message in response
- Log errors server-side
- Don't expose sensitive details
- Handle validation errors
- Handle database errors

### 7.3 Authentication Errors
- Show "invalid credentials" for login failures
- Show "email taken" for duplicate registrations
- Handle expired tokens gracefully
- Redirect to login on auth failures
- Clear invalid tokens from storage

## 8. Testing Requirements (More work still needed)

### 8.1 Manual Testing Checklist
- Register new user
- Login with valid credentials
- Login with invalid credentials
- Logout and session cleared
- Session restored on refresh
- Request employee access
- Create reimbursement
- View own reimbursements
- Filter reimbursements by status
- Manager view all reimbursements
- Approve reimbursement
- Deny reimbursement with comment
- Protected routes redirect when not logged in
- Role-based navigation shows correct items

### 8.2 Automated Testing (Future)
